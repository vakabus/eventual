_The app is still very much work-in-progress. Don't expect much. The description bellow is primarly a statement of goals, not the actual functionality that is currently available._

# Eventual

A tool to support running small scale events, aimed primarly at the organizers.

**Goals:**

- Be trivial to deploy.
- Be easy to use for non-techies.
- Allow easy collaboration in the organizer team.
- Easy import-export of data for use in other tools (Google Forms and Sheets, Airtable, ...).

**Feature goals:**

- Handle email templating and sending to participants. Be able to cope with genders in Czech language.

**Possible new feature ideas:**

- Receive emails and allow replies.
- Allow creation of event registration forms for participants.
- Event planning and scheduling (finish and integrate [planovatko](https://github.com/vakabus/planovatko)).
- Expense tracking.

## Localization

The code is written in English, but the content of the web apps is in Czech.

## License

For now the project is licensed under AGPL. There's definitely a possibility of less restrictive license after a chat.
